# Soyuz2_1v--Razbeg_1-kOS-Scripts-12092021

Craft files for the rocket, and a version without the parts needed for kOS, are included.

Link to Youtube video:


This is the Kerbal Operating System code for a Soyuz 2.1v launch, carrying the Razbeg 1 satellite to SSO.

The code launches the mission into SSO, and deployes the payload.

The boot.ks file opens the kOS Terminal of the kOS processor directly after launching the vessel. This only works if you right-click the kOS processor attached to the launcher's faring base, and select boot file "boot.ks". This file has to be placed inside a "Boot" foder in the KSP/Ships/Script directory.

///NOTES///

-> Tested in Kerbal Space Program Version 1.12.2.
